#### Compatibility Issues

If you encounter compatibility issues with other mods or after an update, first check to see if a related thread already exists in the discussion tab. If not, please open a new thread and add a short description with a screenshot or the text of the error message. I will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible, as far as it is possible on my end.

In the short term, you can try working around compatibility issues with other mods by excluding relevant textures in the mod settings using a checkbox or string input. First, identify the conflicting mod and textures. Then, load the Factorio HD Age mod alone to access the relevant mod settings.

#### Lagging / FPS drops.

As mentioned in the Mod description, each Factorio HD Age mod requires a significant amount of additional VRAM. If the GPU does not have enough VRAM, it may result in stuttering and FPS drops. Although there is some headroom when using shared GPU memory, stuttering and FPS drops may still occur.

If you encounter a VRAM bottleneck and want to avoid stuttering and FPS drops, the Factorio HD Age mods allow you to disable textures.

Depending on how textures are integrated into individual mods, you can deactivate them using checkboxes in the mod options or exclude them by entering a string. For more information, see the tooltip in the mod options.

#### Loading Times

Using all Factorio HD Age mods without any other mods takes around 70 seconds to load on high-end hardware. When used with other mods, loading times of four minutes can be normal.

If you rarely activate or deactivate mods, you can try the following to reduce loading times:

>In the main menu, hold Ctrl + Alt, then click Settings. A new option appears: The Rest. Click that, then under "Other settings" enable "cache-prototype-data" and under "Graphics settings" enable "cache-sprite-atlas". Set "cache-sprite-atlas" to 1 or 2 or so. Now your startup of the same game version + mod combination will be faster.
> __IMPORTANT:__ Once enabled, the game will load slowly on startup one time. Afterwards the game will load significantly faster. If the game is modified by for example being updated or modified (changed or probably updated installed mods), the game will load slowly one time, but consecutively it will load fast again.

#### How were these HD textures created?

All textures were processed using AI-upscaling and sharpening.
Then, the textures were compressed using lossy and lossless PNG compression, which reduced the file size by around 80%.
